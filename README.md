#Example ReactJS project without Redux

Just an example react project which I did to learn ReactJS. May 2017ish.

How to run?

- Clone the repo.
- Run `npm install`
- Run `react-scripts start`

Or just read the `package.json` for more. Has some Redux.

#Note
Things might work, things might not. Don't come after me if this project causes any damage to you or your pets or your business or your sentiments or your ego...Run at your own risk.
